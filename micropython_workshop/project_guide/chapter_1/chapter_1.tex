\chapter{Project 1: Blink}

\section{Overview}
This project is designed to provide a foundation for subsequent projects in this book (\textbf{and beyond}). Over the course of this project, you will:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a simple circuit using your breadboard
\item Write a program that runs in a loop
\item Use MicroPython in your program to interact with your microcontroller's GPIO pins.
\end{itemize}
At the end of this project, your microcontroller should run a MicroPython program which alternates a light between its ON and OFF states. Let's get started!

\section{Directions}

\subsection{Creating the circuit}
Using jumper cables, you will be assembling a circuit between your microcontroller, your breadboard, an LED, and a 220\si{\ohm} resistor.

\subsubsection{Attach the microcontroller to the breadboard}
Carefully insert the pins at the bottom of your microcontroller into the breadboard, making sure that the microcontroller is oriented such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The pin labeled \textbf{3V3} is inserted in hole at \textbf{Column C, Row 1} of the breadboard (or \textbf{C1}, for short)
    \item The pin labeled \textbf{Vin} is inserted in hole \textbf{J1} of the breadboard
    \item The pin labeled \textbf{D0} is inserted in hole \textbf{C15} of the breadboard
    \item the pin labeled \textbf{A0} is inserted in hole \textbf{J15} of the breadboard
\end{itemize}
You may need to apply more pressure than expected to seat the microcontroller properly in the breadboard. When its over, it should look like this:

    \caption{So far, so good!}
    \label{fig:microntroller+breadboard}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Connect your microcontroller to the positive and negative rails of your breadboard}
% Should we have an overview of components before this? Will the girls know what a 'jumper wire' is? Or the layout of the breadboard?
Using a jumper wire, pin one end of the wire into hole \textbf{A1} of the breadboard and the other end on \textit{any} hole in the column labelled with a \textbf{+} on the side of the breadboard. This column is called the \textbf{positive rail}, and will eventually move power from your microcontroller around the circuit we are building.

Using another jumper wire, pin one end of the wire into hole \textbf{A2} and the other into \textit{any} hole in the column labelled with a \textbf{-} on the side of the breadboard. This column is called the \textbf{negative rail} and, like the positive rail, helps to move power around the circuit we are building.

You should be left with something that looks like this:

    \caption{I'm absolutely POSITIVE I connected everything correctly!}
    \label{fig:positives_and_negatives}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Connect microcontroller to LED}

\subsubsection{Connect resistor between LED and negative power rail}

\subsection{Programming the microcontroller}

\section{Review}
% go over what we have accomplished (maybe go into more detail about the circuit and the pins on the microcontroller?

\section{Possible Extensions}
% ideas to expand this project: Add a second light? write a morse code program?
